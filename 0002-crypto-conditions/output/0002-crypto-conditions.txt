Abstract

   The crypto-conditions specification defines a set of encoding formats
   and data structures for *conditions* and *fulfillments*.  A condition
   uniquely identifies a logical "boolean circuit" constructed from one
   or more logic gates, evaluated by either validating a cryptographic
   signature or verifying the preimage of a hash digest.  A fulfillment
   is a data structure encoding one or more cryptographic signatures and
   hash digest preimages that define the structure of the circuit and
   provide inputs to the logic gates allowing for the result of the
   circuit to be evaluated.

   A fulfillment is validated by evaluating that the circuit output is
   TRUE but also that the provided fulfillment matches the circuit
   fingerprint, the condition.

   Since evaluation of some of the logic gates in the circuit (those
   that are signatures) also take a message as input the evaluation of
   the entire fulfillment takes an optional input message which is
   passed to each logic gate as required.  As such the algorithm to
   validate a fulfillment against a condition and a message matches that
   of other signature schemes and a crypto-condition can serve as a
   sophisticated and flexible replacement for a simple signature where
   the condition is used as the public key and the fulfillment as the
   signature.

1.  Introduction

   Crypto-conditions is a scheme for composing signature-like structures
   from one or more existing signature scheme or hash digest primitives.
   It defines a mechanism for these existing primitives to be combined
   and grouped to create complex signature arrangements but still
   maintain the useful properties of a simple signature, most notably,
   that a deterministic algorithm exists to verify the signature against
   a message given a public key.

   Using crypto-conditions, existing primitives such as RSA and ED25519
   signature schemes and SHA256 digest algorithms can be used as logic
   gates to construct complex boolean circuits which can then be used as
   a compound signature.  The validation function for these compound
   signatures takes as input the fingerprint of the circuit, called the
   condition, the circuit definition and minimum required logic gates
   with their inputs, called the fulfillment, and a message.

   The function returns a boolean indicating if the compound signature
   is valid or not.  This property of crypto-conditions means they can
   be used in most scenarios as a replacement for existing signature
   schemes which also take as input, a public key (the condition), a
   signature (the fulfillment), and a message and return a boolean
   result.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Types

   Crypto-conditions are a standard format for expressing conditions and
   fulfillments.  The format supports multiple algorithms, including
   different hash functions and cryptographic signing schemes.  Crypto-
   conditions can be nested in multiple levels, with each level possibly
   having multiple signatures.

   The different types of crypto-conditions each have different internal
   strutures and employ different cryptographic algorithms as
   primitives.

3.1.  Simple and Compound Types

   Two categories of crypto-condition type exist.  Simple crypto-
   conditions provide a standard encoding of common cryptographic
   primitives with hardcoded parameters, e.g RSA and ED25519 signature
   or SHA256 hash digests.  As such, simple types that use the same
   underlying scheme (e.g.  SHA) with different parameters (e.g. 256 or
   512 bits) are considered different crypto-condition types.

   As an example, the types defined in this version of the specification
   all use the SHA-256 digest algorithm to generate the condition
   fingerprint.  If a future version were to introduce SHA-512 as an
   alternative this would require that new types be defined for each
   existing type that must have its condition generated using SHA-512.

   Compound crypto-conditions contain one or more sub-crypto-conditions.
   The compound crypto-condition will evaluate to TRUE or FALSE based on
   the output of the evaluation of the sub-crypto-conditions.  In this
   way compound crypto-conditions are used to construct branches of a
   boolean circuit.

   To validate a compound crypto-condition all sub-crypto-conditions are
   provided in the fulfillment so that the fingerprint of the compound
   condition can be generated.  However, some of these sub-crypto-
   conditions may be sub-fulfillments and some may be sub-conditions,
   depending on the type and properties of the compound crypto-
   condition.

   As an example, in the case of an m-of-n signature scheme, only m sub-
   fulfillments are needed to validate the compound signature, but the
   remaining n-m sub-conditions must still be provided to validate that
   the complete fulfillment matches the originally provided condition.
   This is an important feature for multi-party signing, when not all
   parties are ready to provide fulfillment yet all parties still desire
   fulfillment of the overall condition if enough counter-parties do
   provide fulfillment.

3.2.  Defining and Supporting New types

   The crypto-conditions format has been designed so that it can be
   expanded.  For example, you can add new cryptographic signature
   schemes or hash functions.  This is important because advances in
   cryptography frequently render old algorithms insecure or invent
   newer, more effective algorithms.

   Implementations are not required to support all condition types
   therefore it is necessary to indicate which types an implementation
   must support in order to validate a fulfillment.  For this reason,



Thomas, et al.            Expires June 16, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


   compound conditions are encoded with an additional field, subtypes,
   indicating the set of types and subtypes of all sub-crypto-
   conditions.

4.  Features

   Crypto-conditions offer many of the features required of a regular
   signature scheme but also others which make them useful in a variety
   of new use cases.

4.1.  Multi-Algorithm

   Each condition type uses one or more cryptographic primitives such as
   digest or signature algorithms.  Compound types may contain sub-
   crypto-conditions of any type and indicate the set of underlying
   types in the subtypes field of the condition

   To verify that a given implementation can verify a fulfillment for a
   given condition, implementations MUST ensure they are able to
   validate fulfillments of all types indicated in the subtypes field of
   a compound condition.  If an implementation encounters an unknown
   type it MUST reject the condition as it will almost certainly be
   unable to validate the fulfillment.

4.2.  Multi-Signature

   Crypto-conditions can abstract away many of the details of multi-
   sign.  When a party provides a condition, other parties can treat it
   opaquely and do not need to know about its internal structure.  That
   allows parties to define arbitrary multi-signature setups without
   breaking compatibility.  That said, it is important that
   implementations must inspect the ypes and subtypes of any crypto-
   conditions they encounter to ensure they do not pass on a condition
   they will not be able to verify at a later stage.

   In many instances protocol designers can use crypto-conditions as a
   drop-in replacement for public key signature algorithms and add
   multi-signature support to their protocols without adding any
   additional complexity.

4.3.  Multi-Level

   Crypto-conditions elegantly support weighted multi-signatures and
   multi-level signatures.  A threshold condition has a number of
   subconditions, and a target threshold.  Each subcondition can be a
   signature or another threshold condition.  This provides flexibility
   in forming complex conditions.




Thomas, et al.            Expires June 16, 2017                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


   For example, consider a threshold condition that consists of two
   subconditions, one each from Wayne and Alf. Alf's condition can be a
   signature condition while Wayne's condition is a threshold condition,
   requiring both Claude and Dan to sign for him.

   Multi-level signatures allow more complex relationships than simple
   M-of-N signing.  For example, a weighted condition can support an
   arrangement of subconditions such as, "Either Ron, Mac, and Ped must
   approve; or Smithers must approve."

4.4.  Crypto-conditions as a signature scheme

   Crypto-conditions is a signature scheme for compound signatures which
   has similar properties to most other signature schemes, such as: 1.
   Validation of the signature (the fulfillment) is done using a public
   key (the condition) and a message as input 2.  The same public key
   can be used to validate multiple different signatures, each against a
   different message 3.  It is not possible to derive the signature from
   the public key

   However, the scheme also has a number of features that make it unique
   such as: 1.  It is possible to derive the same public key from any
   valid signature without the message 2.  It is possible for the same
   public key and message to be used to validate multiple signatures.
   For example, the fulfillment of an m-of-n condition will be different
   for each combination of n signatures.  3.  Composite signatures use
   one or more other signatures as components allowing for recursive
   signature validation logic to be defined.
   4.  A valid signature can be produced using different combinations of
   private keys if the structure of the compound signature requires only
   specific combinations of internal signatures to be valid (m of n
   signature scheme).

4.5.  Crypto-conditions as a trigger in distributed systems

   One of the challenges facing a distributed system is achieving atomic
   execution of a transaction across the system.  A common pattern for
   solving this problem is two-phase commit in which the most time and
   resource-consuming aspects of the transaction are prepared by all
   participants following which a simple trigger is sufficient to either
   commit or abort the transaction.  Described in more abstract terms,
   the system consists of a number of participants that have prepared a
   transaction pending the fulfillment of a predefined condition.

   Crypto-conditions defines a mechanism for expressing these triggers
   as pairs of unique trigger identifiers (conditions) and
   cryptographically verifiable triggers (fulfillments) that can be
   deterministically verified by all participants.



Thomas, et al.            Expires June 16, 2017                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


   It is also important that all participants in such a distributed
   system are able to evaluate, prior to the trigger being fired, that
   they will be capable of verifying the trigger.  Determinism is
   useless if validation of the trigger requires algorithms or resources
   that are not available to all participants.

   Therefore conditions may be used as *distributable event
   descriptions* in the form of a _fingerprint_, but also _event meta-
   data_ that allows the event verification system to determine if they
   have the necessary capabilities (such as required crypto-algorithms)
   and resources (such as heap size or memory) to verify the event
   notification later.

   Fulfillments are therefore *cryptographically verifiable event
   notifications* that can be used to verify the event occurred but also
   that it matches the given description.

   When using crypto-conditions as a trigger it will often make sense
   for the message that is used for validation to be empty to match the
   signature of the trigger processing system's API.  This makes crypto-
   conditions compatible with systems that use simple hash-locks as
   triggers.

   If a PKI signature scheme is being used for the triggers this would
   require a new key pair for each trigger which is impractical.
   Therefore the PREFIX compound type wraps a sub-crypto-condition with
   a message prefix that is applied to the message before signature
   validation.  In this way a unique condition can be derived for each
   trigger even if the same key pair is re-used with an empty message.

4.6.  Smart signatures

   In the Interledger protocol, fulfillments provide non-repudiable
   proof that a transaction has been completed on a ledger.  They are
   simple messages that can be easily shared with other ledgers.  This
   allows ledgers to escrow funds or hold a transfer conditionally, then
   execute the transfer automatically when the ledger sees the
   fulfillment of the stated condition.  In this way the Interledger
   protocol synchronizes multiple transfers on distinct ledgers in an
   almost atomic end-to-end transaction.

   Crypto-conditions may also be useful in other contexts where a system
   needs to make a decision based on predefined criteria, and the proof
   from a trusted oracle(s) that the criteria have been met, such as
   smart contracts.

   The advantage of using crypto-conditions for such use cases as
   opposed to a turing complete contract scripting language is the fact



Thomas, et al.            Expires June 16, 2017                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


   that the outcome of a crypto-condition validation is deterministic
   across platforms as long as the underlying cryptographic primitives
   are correctly implemented.

5.  Validation of a fulfillment

   Validation of a fulfillment (F) against a condition (C) and a message
   (M), in the majority of cases, follows these steps:

   1.  The implementation must derive a condition from the fulfillment
       and ensure that the derived condition (D) matches the given
       condition (C).

   2.  If the fulfillment is a simple crypto-condition AND is based upon
       a signature scheme (such as RSA-PSS or ED25519) then any
       signatures in the fulfillment (F) must be verified, using the
       appropriate signature verification algorithm, against the
       corresponding public key, also provided in the fulfillment and
       the message (M) (which may be empty).

   3.  If the fulfillment is a compound crypto-condition then the sub-
       fulfillments MUST each be validated.  In the case of the PREFIX-
       SHA-256 type the sub-fulfillment MUST be valid for F to be valid
       and in the case of the THRESHOLD-SHA-256 type the number of valid
       sub-fulfillments must be equal or greater than the threshold
       defined in F.

   If the derived condition (D) matches the input condition (C) AND the
   boolean circuit defined by the fulfillment evaluates to TRUE then the
   fulfillment (F) fulfills the condition (C).

   A more detailed validation algorithm for each crypto-condition type
   is provided with the details of the type later in this document.  In
   each case the notation F.x or C.y implies; the decoded value of the
   field named x of the fulfillment and the decoded value of the field
   named y of the Condition respectively.

5.1.  Subfulfillments

   In validating a fulfillment for a compound crypto-condition it is
   necessary to validate one or more sub-fulfillments per step 3 above.
   In this instance the condition for one or more of these sub-
   fulfillments is often not available for comparison with the derived
   condition.  Implementations MUST skip the first fulfillment

   The message (M) used to validate sub-fulfillments is the same message
   (M) used to validate F however in the case of the PREFIX-SHA-256 type
   this is prefixed with F.prefix before validation of the sub-
   fulfillment is performed.

6.  Deriving the Condition

   Since conditions provide a unique fingerprint for fulfillments it is
   important that a determinisitic algorithm is used to derive a
   condition.  For each crypto-condition type details are provided on
   how to:

   1.  Assemble the fingerprint content and if neccessary calculate the
       hash digest of this data.

   2.  Calculate the maximum fulfillment length of a fulfillment

   For compound types the fingerprint content will contain the complete,
   encoded, condition for all sub-crypto-conditions.  Implementations
   MUST abide by the ordering rules provided when assembling the
   fingerprint content.

   When calculating the fingerprint of a compound crypto-condition
   implementations MUST first derive the condition for all sub-
   fulfillments and include these conditions when assembling the
   fingerprint content.

6.1.  Conditions as Public Keys

   Since the condition is just a fingerprint and meta-data about the
   crypto-condition it can be transmitted freely in the same way a
   public key is shared publicly.  It's not possible to derive the
   fulfillment from the condition.

7.  Format

   A description of crypto-conditions is provided in this document using
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) as defined in [itu.X680.2015].

7.1.  Encoding Rules

   Implementations of this specificiation MUST support encoding and
   decoding using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) as defined in
   [itu.X690.2015].  This is the canonical encoding format.

   Alternative encodings may be used to represent top-level conditions
   and fulfillments but to ensure a determinisitic outcome in producing

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


   the condition fingerprint content, including any sub-conditions, MUST
   be DER encoded prior to hashing (if hashing is required).

7.2.  Condition

   The binary encoding of conditions differs based on their type.  All
   types define at least a fingerprint and maxFulfillmentLength sub-
   field.  Some types, such as the compound condition types, define
   additional sub-fields that are required to convey essential
   properties of the crypto-condition (such as the sub-types used by
   sub-conditions in the case of the compound types).

   Each crypto-condition type has a type ID.  The list of known types is
   the IANA-maintained Crypto-Condition Type Registry (Appendix D.1).

   Conditions are encoded as follows:

   Condition ::= CHOICE {
         preimageSha256 SimpleCondition,
         prefixSha256 CompoundCondition,
         thresholdSha256 CompoundCondition,
         rsaSha256 SimpleCondition,
         ed25519 SimpleCondition
   }

   SimpleCondition ::= SEQUENCE {
     fingerprint OCTET STRING (SIZE(32)),
     maxFulfillmentLength INTEGER (0..MAX)
   }

   CompoundCondition ::= SEQUENCE {
     fingerprint OCTET STRING (SIZE(32)),
     maxFulfillmentLength INTEGER (0..MAX),
     subtypes ConditionTypes
   }

   ConditionTypes ::= BIT STRING {
     preImageSha256  (0),
     prefixSha256    (1),
     thresholdSha256 (2),
     rsaSha256       (3),
     ed25519         (4)
   }

7.2.1.  Fingerprint

   The fingerprint is an octet string uniquely representing the
   condition with respect to other conditions *of the same type*.

   Implementations which index conditions MUST use the complete encoded
   condition as the key, not just the fingerprint - as different
   conditions of different types may have the same fingerprint.

   For most condition types, the fingerprint is a cryptographically
   secure hash of the data which defines the condition, such as a public
   key.

   For types that use PKI signature schemes, the signature is
   intentionally not included in the content that is used to compose the
   fingerprint.  This means the fingerprint can be calculated without
   needing to know the message or having access to the private key.

   Future types may use different functions to produce the fingerprint
   which may have different lengths therefore the field is encoded as a
   variable length string.

7.2.2.  MaxFulfillmentLength

   This is the maximum length of the fulfillment payload for a
   fulfillment that can fulfill this condition.

   For each crypto-condition type, an algorithm is provided for
   consistently calculating the maximum fulfillment length to ensure
   that implementations produce deterministic output.

   When a crypto-condition is submitted to an implementation, this
   implementation MUST verify that it will be able to process a
   fulfillment with a payload of size maxFulfillmentLength.

7.2.3.  Subtypes

   Subtypes is a bitmap that indicates the set of types an
   implementation must support in order to be able to successfully
   validate the fulfillment of this condition.  This is the set of types
   and subtypes of all sub-crypto-conditions, recursively.

   It must be possible to verify that all types used in a crypto-
   condition are supported (including the types and subtypes of any sub-
   crypto-conditions) even if the fulfillment is not available to be
   analysed yet.  Therefore, all compound conditions set the bits in
   this bitmap that correspond to the set of types and subtypes of all
   sub-crypto-conditions.

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


   The field is encoded as a variable length BIT STRING, as defined in
   ASN.1 to accommodate new types that may be defined.

   Each bit in the bitmap represents a type from the list of known types
   in the IANA-maintained Crypto-Condition Type Registry (Appendix D.1)
   and the bit corresponding to each type is the bit at position X where
   X is the type ID of the type.

   The presence of one or more sub-crypto-conditions of a specific type
   is indicated by setting the numbered bit corresponding to the type ID
   of that type.

   For example, a compound condition that contains an ED25519 crypto-
   condition as a sub-crypto-condition will set the bit at position 4.

   Bits are numbered per the encoding rules for the ASN.1 BIT STRING
   type.

7.3.  Fulfillment

   The ASN.1 definition for fulfillments is defined as follows:

8.  Crypto-Condition Types

   The following condition types are defined in this version of the
   specification.  While support for additional crypto-condition types
   may be added in the future and will be registered in the IANA
   maintained Crypto-Condition Type Registry (Appendix D.1), no other
   types are supported by this specification.

8.1.  PREIMAGE-SHA-256

   PREIMAGE-SHA-256 is assigned the type ID 0.  It relies on the
   availability of the SHA-256 digest algorithm.

   This type of condition is also called a "hashlock".  By creating a
   hash of a difficult-to-guess 256-bit random or pseudo-random integer
   it is possible to create a condition which the creator can trivially
   fulfill by publishing the random value.  However, for anyone else,
   the condition is cryptographically hard to fulfill, because they
   would have to find a preimage for the given condition hash.

   Implementations MUST ignore any input message when validating a
   PREIMAGE-SHA-256 fulfillment as the validation of this crypto-
   condition type only requires that the SHA-256 digest of the preimage,
   taken from the fulfillment, matches the fingerprint, taken from the
   condition.

8.1.1.  Condition Format

   The fingerprint of a PREIMAGE-SHA-256 condition is the SHA-256 hash
   of the unencoded preimage.

8.1.2.  MaxFulfillmentLength

   The maxFulfillmentLength is the size, in bytes, of the preimage.

8.1.3.  Fulfillment Format

   PreimageFulfillment ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (32))

8.1.4.  Validating

   A PREIMAGE-SHA-256 fulfillment is valid iff C.fingerprint is equal to
   the SHA-256 hash digest of F.

8.1.5.  Example

   preimage value: "Hello World!"

8.2.  PREFIX-SHA-256

   PREFIX-SHA-256 is assigned the type ID 1.  It relies on the
   availability of the SHA-256 digest algorithm and any other algorithms
   required by its sub-crypto-condition as it is a compound crypto-
   condition type.

   Prefix crypto-conditions provide a way to narrow the scope of other
   crypto-conditions that are used inside the prefix crypto-condition as
   a sub-crypto-condition.

   Because a condition is the fingerprint of a public key, by creating a
   prefix crypto-condition that wraps another crypto-condition we can
   narrow the scope from signing an arbitrary message to signing a
   message with a specific prefix.

   We can also use the prefix condition in contexts where there is an
   empty message used for validation of the fulfillment so that we can
   reuse the same key pair for multiple crypto-conditions, each with a
   different prefix, and therefore generate a unique condition and
   fulfillment each time.

   Implementations MUST prepend the prefix to the provided message and
   will use the resulting value as the message to validate the sub-
   fulfillment.

8.2.1.  Condition Format

   The fingerprint of a PREFIX-SHA-256 condition is the SHA-256 digest
   of the DER encoded fingerprint contents as defined below:

   PrefixSha256ConditionFingerprintContents ::= SEQUENCE {
     prefix OCTET STRING,
     subcondition Condition
   }

   prefix  is an arbitrary octet string which will be prepended to the
      message during validation.

   subcondition  is the sub-condition derived from the sub-fulfillment.

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


8.2.2.  MaxFulfillmentLength

   The maxFulfillmentLength is the size, in bytes, of the DER encoded
   prefix, including the tag and length indicator byte(s), plus the
   maxFulfillmentLength of the sub-crypto-condition.

8.2.3.  Fulfillment Format

   PrefixFulfillment ::= SEQUENCE {
     prefix OCTET STRING,
     subfulfillment Fulfillment
   }

   prefix  is an arbitrary octet string which will be prepended to the
      message during validation.

   subfulfillment  is the fulfilled subcondition.

8.2.4.  Validating

   A PREFIX-SHA-256 fulfillment is valid iff:

   1.  F.subfulfillment is valid, where the message used for validation
       of F.subfulfillment is M prefixed by F.prefix AND

   2.  D is equal to C.

8.2.5.  Example

   TODO

8.3.  THRESHOLD-SHA-256

   THRESHOLD-SHA-256 is assigned the type ID 2.  It relies on the
   availability of the SHA-256 digest algorithm and any other algorithms
   required by any of its sub-crypto-conditions as it is a compound
   crypto-condition type.

8.3.1.  Condition Format

   The fingerprint of a THRESHOLD-SHA-256 condition is the SHA-256
   digest of the DER encoded fingerprint contents given below:

   ThresholdSha256FingerprintContents ::= SEQUENCE {
     threshold INTEGER (0..65535),
     subconditions SEQUENCE OF Condition
   }

Internet-Draft              Crypto-Conditions              December 2016


   threshold  threshold MUST be an integer in the range 0 ... 65535.  In
      order to fulfill a threshold condition, the number of valid sub-
      fulfillments MUST be greater than or equal to the threshold.

   subconditions  is the set of sub-conditions.

      The list of DER encoded sub-conditions is sorted first based on
      encoded length, shortest first.  Elements of the same length are
      sorted in lexicographic (big-endian) order, smallest first.

8.3.2.  MaxFulfillmentLength

   The maxFulfillmentLength is the the sum of the F.threshold largest
   maxFulfillmentLength values of all sub-conditions where, added to the
   size of the encoded length of the remaining sub-conditions and the
   encoded length of the threshold value.

   For example, if a threshold crypto-condition contains 5 sub-
   conditions with maxFulfillment lengths of 64 bytes, 64 bytes, 82
   bytes, 84 bytes and 84 bytes and encoded sizes of 34 bytes, 34 bytes,
   34 bytes, 68 bytes and 68 bytes respectively and has a threshold of
   3, the maxfulfillmentlength is equal to the sum of the largest three
   sub-condition maxfulfillmentlengths (82 + 84 + 84) plus the lengths
   of the remaining conditions (34 + 34) plus the encoded lenght of the
   threshold (3): 321 bytes

   Implementations SHOULD provide only the number of sub-fulfillments
   required by the threshold as providing more may result in the
   fulfillment length exceeding the stated maxFulfillmentLength.

8.3.3.  Fulfillment Format

   ThresholdFulfillment ::= SEQUENCE {
     threshold INTEGER (1..65535),
     subfulfillments SEQUENCE OF Fulfillment,
     subconditions SEQUENCE OF Condition
   }

   threshold  is a number and MUST be an integer in the range 1 ...
      65535.  In order to fulfill a threshold condition, the count of
      the provided fulfillments MUST be greater than or equal to the
      threshold.

   subfulfillments  is the set of sub-fulfillments.

   subconditions  is the set of sub-conditions provided in place of any
      unfulfilled sub-fulfillment.

8.3.4.  Validating

   A THRESHOLD-SHA-256 fulfillment is valid iff :

   1.  The number of valid F.subfulfillments is equal to or greater than
       F.threshold.

   2.  D is equal to C.

   For each subfulfillment the subfulfillment is validated against the
   message, and the subcondition for that fulfillment is derived.  When
   all subfulfillments have been processed the derived subconditions and
   the provided subconditions are combined and sorted as defined by the
   condition formatting rules and the fingerprint and condition (D) is
   derived from the sequence of these subconditions.

8.4.  RSA-SHA-256

   The signature algorithm used is RSASSA-PSS as defined in PKCS#1 v2.2.
   [RFC8017]

   Implementations MUST NOT use the default RSASSA-PSS-params.
   Implementations MUST use the SHA-256 hash algorithm and therefore,

8.4.1.  Condition Format

   The fingerprint of a RSA-SHA-256 condition is the SHA-256 digest of
   the DER encoded fingerprint contents given below:

   RSASha256FingerprintContents ::= RSAPublicKey

   -- IMPORTS from [RFC8017]{#8017}
   RSAPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
         modulus INTEGER,  -- n
         publicExponent INTEGER -- e
   }

   modulus  the RSA public modulus n.

      Implementations MUST reject moduli smaller than 128 bytes (1017
      bits) or greater than 512 bytes (4096 bits.)  Large moduli slow
      down signature verification which can be a denial-of-service
      vector.  DNSSEC also limits the modulus to 4096 bits [RFC3110].
      OpenSSL supports up to 16384 bits [OPENSSL-X509-CERT-EXAMPLES].

   publicExponent  The corresponding publicExponent e is constrained to
      be the value 65537 as recommended in [RFC4871].  Very large
      exponents can be a DoS vector [LARGE-RSA-EXPONENTS] and 65537 is
      the largest Fermat prime, which has some nice properties

      [USING-RSA-EXPONENT-OF-65537].  This constraint is not reflected
      in the ASN.1 definition as this would affect the encoding but MUST
      be enforced by implementations.

8.4.2.  MaxFulfillmentLength

   The MaxFulfillmentLength is the sum of the encoded length of the
   publicKey and the signature.  The signature MUST be the same encoded
   length as the publicKey.modulus (even if this means adding leading
   zeros) therefor it is possible to calculate the MaxFulfillmentLength
   using just the public key.

8.4.3.  Fulfillment Format

   RsaSha256FulfillmentPayload ::= SEQUENCE {
     publicKey RSAPublicKey,
     signature OCTET STRING
   }

   publicKey  is the DER encoded RSA public key

   signature  is an octet string representing the RSA signature.  It
      MUST be encoded in big-endian byte order. with the exact same
      number of octets as the modulus of the public key, even if this
      means adding leading zeros.  This ensures that the fulfillment
      size is constant and known ahead of time.  Note that the field is
      still binary encoded with a length prefix for consistency.

      Implementations MUST verify that the signature and modulus consist
      of the same number of octets and that the signature is numerically
      less than the modulus.

   The message to be signed is provided separately.  If no message is
   provided, the message is assumed to be an octet string of length
   zero.

8.4.4.  Implementation

   The recommended modulus size as of 2016 is 2048 bits
   [KEYLENGTH-RECOMMENDATION].  In the future we anticipate an upgrade
   to 3072 bits which provides approximately 128 bits of security
   [NIST-KEYMANAGEMENT] (p. 64), about the same level as SHA-256.

8.5.  ED25519

   ED25519 is assigned the type ID 4.  It relies on the SHA-512 digest
   algorithm and the ED25519 signature scheme as the condition
   fingerprint is not a digest.

   The exact algorithm and encodings used for the public key and
   signature are defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] as Ed25519.  SHA-512
   is used as the hashing function for this signature scheme.

8.5.1.  Condition Format

   The fingerprint of an ED25519 condition is the 32 byte Ed25519 public
   key.  Since the public key is already very small and constant size,
   we do not hash it.

9.  URI Encoding Rules

   Implementations MUST support these encoding rules for encoding
   conditions and fulfillments as URIs.  The URI encoding is only used
   to encode top-level conditions and fulfillments and never for sub-
   conditions and sub-fulfillments.  The binary encoding is considered
   the canonical encoding.

   The following types are defined for the URI encoding:

   BASE10  Variable-length integer encoded as a base-10 (decimal)
      number.  Implementations MUST reject encoded values that are too
      large for them to parse.  Implementations MUST be tested for
      overflows.

   BASE16  Variable-length integer encoded as a base-16 (hexadecimal)
      number.  Implementations MUST reject encoded values that are too
      large for them to parse.  Implementations MUST be tested for
      overflows.  Encodings may have an odd number of characters as the
      encoding excludes leading zeros.

   BASE64URL  Base64-URL encoding.  See [RFC4648], Section 5.

9.1.  Condition URI Format

   Conditions are ASCII encoded as per the ASN.1 data structure with a
   URI scheme of "cc" and the following encoding rules for invidual
   fields, whicha re each separated by the colon (":") character:

   1.  The CHOICE ASN.1 type is represented by the type name from the
       Crypto-Condition Type Registry (Appendix D.1).  The convention is
       to encode this value in lowercase but since URIs are not case
       sensitive this is not a normative requirement and implementations
       MUST accept values in any case.

   2.  The fingerprint field, defined as an OCTET STRING in ASN.1 is
       encoded as a BASE64URL string for the URI.

   3.  The maxFulfillmentLength field, defined as an INTEGER in ASN.1 is
       encoded as a BASE10 string representation of the number.

   4.  The subtypes field, present for compound crypto-condition types,
       is represented as a comma separated list of the type names of all
       sub-types.

   The resulting encoding looks as follows for a simple condition: "cc:"
   type-name ":" BASE64URL(fingerprint) ":" BASE10(maxFulfillmentLength)

   And as follows for a compound condition:
   "cc:" type-name ":" BASE64URL(fingerprint) ":"
   BASE10(maxFulfillmentLength) ":" subtype-name1,subtype-name2,subtype-
   nameN

Appendix A.  Security Considerations

   This specification has a normative dependency on a number of other
   specifications with extensive security considerations therefore the
   consideratons defined for SHA-256 hashing and RSA signatures in
   [RFC8017]{#RFC8017} and [RFC4055]{#RFC4055} and for ED25519
   signatures in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa]{#I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa} must be
   considered.

   The MaxFulfillmentLength and subtypes values of conditions are
   provided to allow implementations to evaluate their ability to
   validate a fulfillment for the given condition later.
   Implementations must ensure that processing a fulfillment of the
   specified size will not result in any overflow errors that may
   introduce security risks.

Appendix B.  Test Values
